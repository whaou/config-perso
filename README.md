# config-perso
This repository contains a collection of configuration files for my linux environment (.bashrc, .gitconfig....)
One way to keep it up to date is to clone the repository in a local directory and to 
 - either replace original files by symlinks to that directory
 - or to append a source, import (or whatever) command at the end of the original config file to add the content of my own config
Still under work... I'm still wondering about the correct way to automatise that!
